*Building a number guessing game

You have learnt enough about Rust, now it's time to build your first Rust project. In this tutorial, we're going to build a simple number guessing game.

Here's how it works, the program will generate a random number between 1 and 100. The user will have to guess the number. If the user's guess is higher than the random number, the program will display "Too high!". If the user's guess is lower, the program will display "Too low!". If the user guesses the number correctly, the program will display "You win!".

The user will have a limited number of attempts to guess the number. If the user runs out of attempts, the program will display "You lose!".
